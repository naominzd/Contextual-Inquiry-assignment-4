# Interviewing People in Context - LGBTQ Community

### DH150 Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry by Naomi Deng

Design Challenge

- There are three main activities the project would support users: 1. To search for resources, information and 2. build a community specifically for individuals within the LGBTQ community on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles.  Basic need involved in these activities is Esteem, love and belonging, safety. For individuals who belong to the community, they need to eliminate the sense of low self-esteem or self-consciousness due to the association with the LGBTQ community. Additionally, to conquer issues with their self-expression and self-recognition, they seek for love and belongingness by doing these activities and acquiring information that bestows them with warmth, inclusion, and comfort. Last but not least, doing these activities help them identify individuals with similar experiences and struggles, thereby form solitude and instill safety. As for LGBTQ individuals specifically, there are some current and traditional solutions in satisfying these needs. Firstly, individuals may choose to search for information regarding LGBTQ in helping themselves self-recognized and identify safety measures in express their identities to others. They might go ask certain people around the campus about where they can find such information regarding LGBTQ group. After identifying the specific organizations and groups tailored for the LGBTQ community, they will join, connect, build rapport based on commonalities, shared experiences and struggles and find consolation. For the need of safety, individuals usually rely on each other. They form a group with mutual support and solitude where they feel safe. However, limitations exist in the traditional ways of finding resources and building connections with similar individuals. For example, by physically going to ask different groups and finding resources through different outlets could take up a huge amount of time. Additionally, the community brings commitment. Joining a support group means an individual has channels to seek help, care, and support, but it might also bring meetings, group gatherings and other activities that burden specific individuals. These issues could potentially be improved by technology. For example, instead of using physical strength to find resources, internet and LGBTQ websites offer easier access in assisting individuals to narrow down the information they need and are most interested in. In addition, for individuals who seek specific help and support but are afraid of too much commitment, joining online LGBTQ support group chat might be a more optimistic option.
